## What We Fixed

### Test Discovery Issue (HELP.md)
The `e2e-full-journey.spec.js` file was missing from testMatch array in playwright.config.js, causing "No tests found" errors after git reset.

**Fix:** Added `'**/e2e-full-journey.spec.js'` to testMatch array.

### Key Improvements Applied to All Parts

#### 1. Comprehensive Logging
Every major step now logs its state before asserting:
```javascript
console.log('Navigating to login page...');
console.log(`Current URL: ${page.url()}`);
console.log('Filling in credentials...');
console.log('✅ On dashboard');
```

#### 2. Flexible Selectors
Handle both `<button>` and `<a>` tags:
```javascript
const button = page.locator(
  'button:has-text("Text"), ' +
  'a:has-text("Text")'
).first();
```

#### 3. URL Pattern Support
Handle optional trailing slashes:
```javascript
await expect(page).toHaveURL(/\/dashboard\/?/);
await expect(page).toHaveURL(/\/status\/?\?id=/);
```

#### 4. Smart State Checking
Check current page state before toggling:
```javascript
const titleText = await authTitle.textContent();
if (titleText && titleText.includes('Sign In')) {
  await toggleSignUpBtn.click();
}
```

## Files Modified

- **HELP.md** (new) - Documents test discovery issue
- **NEXT.md** (this file) - Tracks progress
- **tests/e2e/e2e-full-journey.spec.js** - Enhanced all 14 test parts with logging
- **playwright.config.js** - Already has testMatch pattern ✅

---

## Success Criteria Met ✅

- ✅ All 14 E2E test parts passing
- ✅ All 12 smoke tests passing
- ✅ Can roll back to any commit and tests still work
- ✅ All changes committed (no uncommitted working files)
- ✅ Tests work locally (emulators) ← **VERIFIED**
- ⏳ Tests work in CI (GitHub Actions) ← **NEXT STEP**

---

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Local Testing ✅ COMPLETE

All files verified and committed:
- ✅ playwright.config.js (with testMatch pattern)
- ✅ tests/e2e/e2e-full-journey.spec.js (all 14 test parts)
- ✅ tests/global-setup.js & tests/global-teardown.js
- ✅ tests/fixtures/firebase-helpers.js
- ✅ tests/fixtures/test-id-generator.js
- ✅ HELP.md (documents test discovery issue)
- ✅ NEXT.md (this file)

**How to reproduce locally:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start emulators
./start-emulators.sh

# Terminal 2: Run E2E tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/e2e-full-journey.spec.js --workers=1
```

### Phase 2: GitHub Actions Integration ⏳ NEXT

Need to configure GitHub Actions workflow to:
1. Start Firebase emulators
2. Run E2E tests with `--workers=1`
3. Upload test artifacts on failure

### Phase 3: Pull Request

Once CI passes, create PR to merge into main branch.

### Phase 4: Monitor for Flakiness

The tests include advanced scenarios (concurrent users, rapid operations, session persistence) that may need monitoring for stability.
